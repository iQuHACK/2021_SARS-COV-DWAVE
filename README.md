# Team 16: DQM Maximization of COVID Vaccine  Distribution
Manjunath Rao, Vincent Pisani, Gary Sung, Anna Kristha Almaz√°n Favela

## Introduction


## Sample Set
Total Vaccine Deliveries (per week)
* Delivery 1 = 50400 
* Delivery 2 = 78000
* Delivery 3 = 19500
* Delivery 4 = 68400
* Delivery 5 = 1000
* Delivery 6 = 43200
* Delivery 7 = 72000
* Delivery 8 = 1900
* Delivery 9 = 132600
* Delivery 10 = 132600  


Knapsack Value: Vaccinated Count
* California      3,000,000
* Ohio              900,000
* Massachusetts     550,000

Rounded values from US Labratory Testing  

Knapsack Weight: Delivery Rate
* California         54.63%
* Ohio               58.63%
* Massachusetts      51.56%

Within each state: divided total doses administered by total distributed  



Total knapsack value = total doses administered (Our Goal)
Total knapsack weight = total doses distributed for CA, OH, MA (8,280,950)


## Data Collection
Centrally Distributed Vaccines and Ancillary Kits
* Moderna: kits with 100 doses or pallet with 3,600 doses
* Pfizer: kits with 975 doses or pallet with 7,800 doses  

Delivery
* Vaccine Kits/Pallets: 3600, 7800, 975, 3600, 100, 3600, 3600, 100, 7800, 7800
* Kits/Pallet Count per Delivery: 14, 10, 20, 19, 10, 12, 20, 19, 17, 17
Based on the CDC Moderna and Pfizer weekly shipment of doses data.
Shipments suggest that truckloads generally hold <50% capacity of pallets
