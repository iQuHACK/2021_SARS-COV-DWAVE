Manjunath Rao, Vincent Pisani, Gary Sung, Anna Kristha AlmazÃ¡n Favela

## Introduction


## Sample Set
1 delivery = 200,000 vaccines
Total deliveries = 10
Max deliveries per state = 5


Knapsack Value: Vaccinated Count
> California      3,000,000
> Ohio              900,000
> Massachusetts     550,000
Rounded values from US Labratory Testing

Knapsack Weight: Delivery Rate
> California         54.63%
> Ohio               58.63%
> Massachusetts      51.56%
Within each state: divided total doses administered by total distributed

Total knapsack value = total doses administered (Our Goal)
Total knapsack weight = total doses distributed for CA, OH, MA (8,280,950)
Total doses distributed 


## Basic Principles

## Data Collection
CDC COVID [Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html#datatracker-home) - [US Lab Testing](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#testing_tests7day)
