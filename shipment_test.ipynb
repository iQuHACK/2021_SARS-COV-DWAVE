    "# DQM Maximization of COVID Vaccine Distribution\n",

The distribution center's goal is to maximize the number of people who receive the vaccine. It must consider the rate of vaccine administration per state as well as the sizes of the shipment offers to put as many vaccines as possible to good use."
