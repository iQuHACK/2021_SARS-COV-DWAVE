    "# DQM Maximization of COVID Vaccine Distribution\n",
    "We applied a DQM solution of the Knapsack problem to the issue of COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Specifically, we focused on how vaccines arriving in the United States would be distributed to individual states. \n",

    "In this model, the federal vaccine distribution center is receiving offers from states to ship a given number of vaccines. The distribution center's goal is to maximize the number of people who receive the vaccine. It must consider the rate of vaccine administration per state as well as the sizes of the shipment offers to put as many vaccines as possible to good use."
